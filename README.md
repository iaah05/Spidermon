Monitoring of a Spider Terrarium

Last year, my son got a pet velvet spider which required background heating. Instead of getting something off the shelf, I opted to build a controller with an ESP8266 and setup a thermostat so I could actively monitor the temperature and switch on the heatmat as and when required. I also wanted to monitor from Home Assistant so I could be alerted should thresholds be breached or even if the device itself went offline.

This year [2024] we got another spider (Phidippus Johnsoni) so I set about building a second controller, this time documenting the build.

Components.
